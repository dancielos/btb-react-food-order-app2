# React: Back to Basics
This project serves as a personal playground and is one of my quests for mastering React.

## Why Revisit the Basics?
In the fast-paced world of web development, revisiting the basics is essential. By developing a simple food order app, I can re-learn the stuff I already knew but barely used. Most importantly, I attain new insights to help me become a better React developer.

Some of these insights I learned include:
### 1. Guard Clause vs. if-else if-else
I’ve always used the if-else if-else for any conditionals. But when I went back to basics, it turns out there’s a pattern called guard clause. And ironically, it’s a common practice nowadays; I was just left in the dark about it.
Using the guard clause makes my codes look cleaner, making them easier to understand and maintain. 
### 2. Leveraging key={stateThatChanges} rather than using useEffect inside the child component
### 3. Destructuring Props ({prop1, prop2}) vs. using props Parameter (props)
This technique makes the code easier to maintain as I don’t have to go back and forth between files to figure out what props I’m passing.
### 4. Optimistic Update for Real-time Interactivity

## Conclusion
When it comes to mastering a skill, there's this golden rule: repetition. That's why I occasionally circle back to the basics. It's like giving your skills a friendly refresher course—keeps things sharp and on point!
